# awesome-devtools-EU
A curated collection of developer‑first tools built in Europe.

## How to contribute

**Pick a country file**: Open the markdown file that corresponds to the country where the tool originates (e.g., france.md).

**Add a new entry**: Insert the tool under the appropriate category and include:

**Name**: the official product name.

**Link**: a URL that points to the tool’s homepage or repository.

**Tags**: useful hashtags such as #oss, #selfhosted, #cloud.

**Missing a country?** Create a new markdown file by copying and renaming the template.md file.

**Eligibility** The company must have been founded in a European country. If the company later relocates outside the EU, you may still keep the tool in the list.

Obviously I am not omnicient :-) Help me fill these repository with your favorite european dev tools.
